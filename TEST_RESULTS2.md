This comprehensive analysis summarizes the technical specifications, quality assurance requirements, and material criteria for wood doors as detailed in Section 081416 of the provided document, DG-NCD-406-0000-SFC-SPC-AR-000001-266-280.pdf.
General Scope, Standards, and Quality Assurance

This specification section covers solid-core doors with wood-veneer and plastic-laminate faces, factory finishing, factory fitting, machining for hardware, and the provision of Najdi style Solid Wood Doors 1. The work must be coordinated with related sections, including Section 081113 "Hollow Metal Doors & Frames" for metal frames 2 and Sections 099123/099300 for field finishing 3.
#### Applicable Standards and Regulatory ComplianceThe minimum standards for products include adherence to several international and local codes, with the requirement that the most stringent conditions/requirements shall apply in cases of conflict 4.
  Wood and Performance Standards: Requirements cite Window and Door Manufacturers Association (WDMA) standards such as I.S.6-99 and ANSI/WDMA I.S.6A-01 for wood stile and rail doors
5, along with testing methods like TM-10-90 for screw holding 6. Doors must also comply with WDMA I.S.1-A, "Architectural Wood Flush Doors," and bear AWI Quality Certification Labels 7.
  Fire and Safety Codes: Fire-rated door construction must conform to UL 10 B and NFPA 252 requirements
8 and installation must comply with NFPA 80 9.
  Local Regulations: Compliance is mandatory with all applicable requirements of the Laws, Codes, and Regulations of Authorities having Jurisdiction, including the latest Saudi Building Code (SBC-201)
10 and the Saudi Fire & Life Safety Code of Practice 11.
#### Manufacturer and Performance GradesThe manufacturer must be certified for WDMA quality standards and be a certified participant in AWI's Quality Certification Program 12. WDMA I.S.1-A performance grades are specified based on location:
  Extra Heavy Duty: Required for public toilets, janitor's closets, and exits
13.
  Standard Duty: Required for closets (excluding janitor's closets) and private toilets
14.
  Heavy Duty: Required unless otherwise indicated
15.
Sustainability and Environmental Requirements

The project targets LEED Gold BD+C V4 and MOSTADAM COMMERCIAL Gold D+C ratings 16. When LEED and MOSTADAM requirements differ, the Contractor must follow the more stringent and onerous requirement to ensure compliance with both ratings 17.
#### Low-Emitting Materials (MOSTADAM HC-11 / LEED EQc2)Materials must comply with strict VOC and formaldehyde emission limits:
  Adhesives and Sealants: A minimum of 100% (by weight) of interior adhesives and sealants must not exceed the VOC limits of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1168
18. All materials used for the interior must also comply with the emissions stated in the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Standard Method v1.1-2010 19.
  Composite Wood Formaldehyde Limits: Internal composite wood materials must meet maximum formaldehyde emissions as follows: Hardwood plywood at 0.05 ppm
20; Particle board at 0.09 ppm 21; and Medium-density Fiberboard (MDF) at 0.11 ppm 22.
  Paints and Coatings: A minimum of 100% (by weight) of interior paints and coatings must not exceed the VOC limits of SCAQMD Rule 1113, Green Seal GS-03 & GS-11
23.
#### Sustainable Materials (MOSTADAM MW-05)At least 50% of all timber and composite wood products (by cost) used for temporary construction, permanently installed products, and furniture must be certified with Chain of Custody (CoC) certification 24.
Product Specifications

  Construction and Core: The door thickness shall be not less than 45mm
26. The core must be a noncombustible mineral product 27.
  Rails and Blocking: Top and bottom rails must be Structural Composite Lumber (SCL) or a UL approved composite material to meet label requirements
28. Composite blocking with improved screw holding capability is required, including 125mm blocking at the top rail, bottom rail, and mid-rail (for exit devices) 29.
