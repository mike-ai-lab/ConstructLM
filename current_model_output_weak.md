Below is a concise, structured overview of the key requirements contained in the specification.  Every fact is immediately followed by a citation to the source PDF.

1. General Information
Scope – Covers fire‑protection‑rated glazing, framing, and storefront entrances.

1
Definitions –
Fire‑Protection‑Rated Glazing – up to 45 min rating, size‑limited, no radiant‑heat blocking.

2
Fire‑Resistance‑Rated Glazing – ≥ 60 min rating, no size limits.

3
Glass Thicknesses – indicated in millimetres per ASTM C1036.

4

2. Performance Requirements
General – Must pass testing for fire‑rated glass and framing assemblies without failure due to manufacturing or installation defects.

5
Fire‑Protection‑Rated Glazing –
Must be listed and labeled by an acceptable testing agency (NFPA 257 or UL 9).

6
20‑min rating units are exempt from hose‑stream testing.

7
Label must show manufacturer, test standard, use in doors/openings, hose‑stream pass, temperature‑rise limit (450 °F/250 °C), and rating.

8
Specific product types:
6 mm tempered glass (Category II) – 16 CFR 1201.

9
19 mm monolithic low‑iron glass for doors/openings – 16 CFR 1201.

10
8 mm laminated ceramic glazing (two clear plies).

11
Laminated glass with intumescent interlayer – multiple plies of uncoated clear or low‑iron float glass.

12
Double‑glazing units with clear intumescent interlayer – two or more lites of fully tempered glass.

13
Fire‑Resistance‑Rated Glazing –
Listed and labeled per ASTM E119 or UL 263.

14
Framing and doors must match the glazing rating (60, 90, 120 min).

15
Laminated glass with intumescent interlayers and tempered units with clear intumescent interlayer also comply with 16 CFR 1201, Category II.

16
Window/Wall Glazing Assemblies – Must be listed and labeled for the indicated fire‑resistance rating per ASTM E119 or ANSI/UL 263.

17
Fire‑Protection‑Rated Window/Sidelite/Transom & Door Assemblies – Must be tested per NFPA 257/UL 9 for windows and NFPA 252/UL 10C for doors.

18
Fire‑Rated Temperature‑Rise Door Assembly – Tested per NFPA 252 or UL 10C.

19

3. Glazing Accessories
Sealants – Neutral‑curing silicone (ASTM C920, Type S, Grade NS, Class 50, Use NT).

20
Back‑Bedding Mastic Tapes – Preformed, butyl‑based, 100 % solids, elastomeric, non‑staining, non‑migrating, ASTM C1281 and AAMA 800 compliant.

21
Expanded Cellular Glazing Tapes – Closed‑cell PVC foam, factory‑coated adhesive, AAMA 800 compliant.

22
Cylindrical Glazing Sealant Backing – ASTM C1330, Type O (open‑cell).

23
Perimeter Insulation – Must be approved by a testing agency for the specific fire‑resistance rating.

24

4. Fabrication & Finishes
Fabrication – Units must be cut to fit openings with proper edge and face clearances, per manufacturer instructions and glazing standards.

25
High‑Performance Organic Finish – Two‑coat fluoropolymer (AAMA 2605) with ≥ 70 % PVDF resin in the color coat.

26

5. Hardware
Door Hardware – Must be the manufacturer’s recommended hardware, compatible with the tested assembly, and compliant with Section 08 7100 “Door Hardware.”

27

6. Execution – Installation & Quality Assurance
Step	Key Requirement	Citation
**Examination**	Verify framing, glazing channels, and stops for size, squareness, offsets, and clearances before installation.
28 || Preparation | Clean channels and framing members immediately before glazing; remove loose coatings. | 29 || Glazing Identification | Mark fire side and protected side; avoid visible marks. | 30 || Installation | Follow manufacturer’s recommendations and approved shop drawings; apply primers where required; use setting blocks and spacers per glazing publications; do not exceed edge pressures; provide spacers for lites > 50 in. | 31 || Protection & Cleaning | Remove non‑permanent labels; protect glass from contaminants; wash surfaces no more than four days before inspection; replace damaged glass. | 32 |

7. Warranty
Laminated Glass – Manufacturer will replace units that deteriorate within five years from substantial completion.

33
Tempered Glazing with Intumescent Interlayer – Same five‑year warranty for deterioration (e.g., air bubbles, contamination).
