    *   Bevel non-fire-rated doors 3-1/2 degrees at lock and hinge edges [CITE:DG-NCD-406-0000-SFC-SPC-AR-000001-266-280.pdf "Bevel non-fire-rated doors 3-1/2 degrees"].
    *   Bevel fire-rated doors 3-1/2 degrees at the lock edge; trim stiles and rails only as permitted by the labeling agency [CITE:DG-NCD-406-0000-SFC-SPC-AR-000001-266-280.pdf "Bevel fire-rated doors 3-1/2 degrees"].
    *   Seal edges of doors, cutouts, and mortises after fitting and machining [CITE:DG-NCD-406-0000-SFC-SPC-AR-000001-266-280.pdf "Seal edges of doors"].
*   **Factory-Fitted Doors:** Align in frames for uniform clearance [CITE:DG-NCD-406-0000-SFC-SPC-AR-000001-266-280.pdf "Align in frames for uniform clearance"].

### Adjusting

*   Rehang or replace doors that do not swing or operate freely [CITE:DG-NCD-406-0000-SFC-SPC-AR-000001-266-280.pdf "Rehang or replace doors"].
