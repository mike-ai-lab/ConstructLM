Highlights
The project is a mixed‑use campus with a total built‑up area of 87 210 m² for the university and 22 790 m² for the Bawabah office block.
Both components feature a comprehensive scope of work covering masonry, non‑structural steel, thermal & moisture protection, and door/window systems.
The design emphasizes traditional Najdi architectural elements, especially in the Bawabah office spaces, to blend cultural heritage with modern office standards.
Detailed zone planning ensures functional segregation of campus activities, from reception and lecture halls to dining and wellness facilities.
