**Summary of DG‑NCD‑400‑0000‑AYS‑DWG‑AR‑700‑0079072 (PDF)**  

| Item | Description (as shown in the drawing) | Key Details & Dimensions | Location / Use |
|------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Drawing Identification** | “0079072” appears on several title‑block lines and in the drawing‑number field. | Drawing number **0079072**; Scale **1 : 50**; Revision – “REV 1”. | King Salman University, AD DIRIYAH, Riyadh (Saudi Arabia). |
| **Project Information** | Project title, address, and consultants are listed in the header. | “PROJECT TITLE – KING SALMAN UNIVERSITY”; Address “8500 Prince Sattam Ibn Abdulaziz St, Al Sodha Dist, AD DIR’IYAH, RIYADH 12572‑4000”. | – |
| **Typical Interior Windows – Types & Locations** | The drawing lists a series of interior window families (INT‑A … INT‑H) with associated locations. | • **INT‑A‑N / INT‑A‑O** – “TYPE: INT‑A” – **Location: AUDITORIUM**  <br>• **INT‑B‑N** – “TYPE: INT‑B” – **Location: AUDITORIUM**  <br>• **INT‑C‑N** – “TYPE: INT‑C” – **Location: DAYCARE**  <br>• **INT‑D‑N** – “TYPE: INT‑D” – **Location: Z7 OFFICE SUITE**  <br>• **INT‑E‑N** – “TYPE: INT‑E” – **Location: Z4 MAJLIS**  <br>• **INT‑F‑O** – “TYPE: INT‑F” – **Location: LIBRARY**  <br>• **INT‑G‑O** – “TYPE: INT‑G” – **Location: LIBRARY**  <br>• **INT‑H‑N** – “INT‑H‑N – SQUASH COURT – INTERIOR”. | – |
| **Representative Dimensions** | A series of numeric values (mm) are placed next to each window type. | • **900 mm**, **1050 mm**, **1600 mm**, **1500 mm**, **2500 mm**, **1400 mm**, **1000 mm**, **1800 mm**, **600 mm**, **2100 mm**, **2800 mm**, **2400 mm**, **1305 mm**, **115 mm**, **950 mm**, **300 mm**, **2450 mm**, **152 mm**, **12 mm** (clear tempered glass thickness). | These dimensions correspond to overall opening widths, heights, and glazing thicknesses for the various interior window families. |
| **Glazing & Finishes** | The drawing repeatedly references “CLEAR TEMPERED GLASS” and associated hardware. | • **12 MM CLEAR TEMPERED GLASS** (multiple mentions).  <br>• **ALUMINUM BRACKET**, **ALUMINUM U‑CHANNEL**, **ALUMINUM COVER SHEET**, **ALUMINUM EDGE**.  <br>• **SILICONE JOINT** and **CLEAR SILICONE** for sealing.  <br>• **ANCHOR FIXINGS IN EPOXY RESIN** for mounting. | Typical interior window finish specification. |
| **Additional Details** | “FRIT PATTERN REFER TO DOOR 19 FOR FRIT PATTERN DETAILING” appears near the INT‑H‑N entry. | Indicates a frit (patterned glass) detail that should be cross‑referenced with Door 19 on the same drawing set. | – |
| **Court‑Related Elements** | The term “SQUASH COURT – INTERIOR” is attached to INT‑H‑N. | The drawing includes “TYPICAL COURT FLOOR BLOCKING”, “FINISHED COURT WALL”, and “FINISHED FLOOR” notes, suggesting the window is part of a squash‑court interior wall assembly. | – |
| **General Notes & Disclaimers** | Standard disclaimer text appears in the lower‑right of the sheet. | “DO NOT SCALE THIS DRAWING”, “The Contractor shall not be relieved of responsibility…”, and copyright notice for Diriyah Gate Company Limited (DGCL). | – |
| **Reference Files & BIM Link** | The title block lists a BIM 360 path. | “BIM 360://DGDA‑King Salman University/DG‑NCD‑400‑0000‑AYS‑DDE‑AR‑A00‑0000007_rvt.rvt”. | Indicates the Revit model that underlies this drawing. |

### How to Use This Information  

1. **Identify the correct window family** for a given interior space (e.g., Auditorium → INT‑A, Library → INT‑F/INT‑G).  
2. **Apply the listed dimensions** (width, height, glazing thickness) when ordering or fabricating the units.  
3. **Follow the finish schedule** – clear tempered glass of 12 mm thickness, aluminum brackets/U‑channels, silicone joints, and epoxy‑resin anchor fixings.  
4. **Cross‑reference frit patterns** with Door 19 if a patterned glass finish is required for the squash‑court window (INT‑H‑N).  
5. **Consult the BIM 360 model** (link above) for 3‑D coordination, clash detection, and detailed assembly instructions.
