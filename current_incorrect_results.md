## King Salman Knowledge District (KSKD) Package 1: Executive Summary

The KSKD Project in Diriyah, Riyadh, is a major development combining large-scale educational and commercial infrastructure. Package 1 defines the additional scope of work focusing on the architectural envelope and non-structural components for both King Salman University (KSU) and the Bawabah Offices (BWB), with a target completion date of 2025 {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 1}}.

### I. Comparative Project Metrics

The overall KSKD project covers a vast built-up area exceeding 100,000 m², structured across six primary structural levels for each component.

| Project Component | Function | Built-Up Area (m²) | Levels | Architectural Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **King Salman University (KSU)** | Educational Campus (8 buildings) | 87,210 m² {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 2|Build Up Area: 87,210 m²}} | 6 (2 Basements, 3 Floors, Roof) | Modern, interconnected campus |
| **Bawabah Offices (BWB)** | Grade A Commercial Office Space | 22,790 m² {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 8|Build Up Area: 22,790 m²}} | 6 (2 Basements, 2 Floors, 2 Roofs) | Traditional Najdi |

### II. King Salman University (KSU) Structure and Function

The KSU project is characterized by its scale, comprehensive connectivity, and functional segmentation into three distinct hubs.

#### A. Campus Architecture and Connectivity
*   **Structure:** Composed of eight separate buildings (Z1–Z8) {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 2|eight buildings (Z 1 - Z 8 )}}.
*   **Subterranean Linkage:** All buildings share a common basement, crucial for centralized mechanical, service distribution, and support spaces {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 2|shared basement}}.
*   **Above-Grade Connectivity:** Interconnection is achieved through colonnades, upper-level walkways, and bridges, ensuring shaded and direct pathways throughout the large campus {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 2|Colonnades, upper level walkways and bridges}}.

#### B. Functional Hub Breakdown
1.  **The University Hub:** Serves as the public and administrative center, housing central administration, event/exhibition spaces, and dining/VIP areas {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 2|The University Hub}}.
2.  **The Academic Core:** Contains the individual schools and a shared commons building dedicated to executive and virtual learning functions {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 2|The Academic Core}}.
3.  **The Health and Wellness Hub:** Dedicated to student life, including recreation space, student services offices, and main campus prayer halls {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 2|The Health and Wellness hub}}.

### III. Bawabah Offices (BWB) Architectural and Functional Details

The BWB component is designed to provide high-quality commercial space for Diriyah Company, strongly rooted in local architectural tradition.

#### A. Architectural Philosophy
*   **Style:** Utilizes the traditional **Najdi architectural style** {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 8|Najdi architectural style}}.
*   **Design Feature:** Features internalized courtyards, a traditional element that maximizes daylight penetration into the occupied Grade A office spaces {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 8|internalized courtyards will provide}}.
*   **Occupancy:** The space is specifically designed for occupation by Diriyah Company {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 8|occupied by Diriyah Company}}.

### IV. Detailed Construction Scope of Work (Package 1)

Package 1 focuses heavily on the building envelope, internal walls, and access elements, integrating both contemporary materials and traditional Najdi components.

#### A. Masonry and Traditional Elements
Both KSU and BWB share a commitment to traditional construction materials:
*   **Standard Masonry:** Blockwork and Control joint installation are required for both projects {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 3|Blockwork}} {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 9|Blockwork}}.
*   **Adobe Mud Brick:** The installation of Adobe mud brick walls is a crucial scope item for both KSU and BWB, designated as **Free Issue Material** {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 3|Adobe mud brick wall ( free Issue Material)}} {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 9|Adobe mud brick wall ( free Issue Material)}}.
*   **BWB Specific:** The Bawabah scope explicitly includes internal Walls and Piers construction {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 9|Walls and Piers (Internal)}}.

#### B. Thermal and Moisture Protection
A comprehensive system of waterproofing and insulation is required across both sites to ensure long-term durability and energy efficiency:
*   **Waterproofing:** Includes Waterproofing (WP) to wet areas, general Waterproofing membrane, and GRP lining for critical areas {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 3|Waterproofing membrane}} {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 9|WP to wet areas}}.
*   **Insulation:** External Wall Insulation is mandatory for both projects, alongside Vapor barriers for KSU and combined Vapor and WP for BWB walls {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 3|Wall Insulation (External)}} {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 9|Vapor and WP for the wall}}.
*   **Roofing:** KSU requires specific finishes like Paver tiles and Quarry stone pebbles at the roof level {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 3|Paver tiles at roof}}. BWB requires a full Roofing system implementation {{citation:Summary BWB+KSU-KSKD Project-Rany.pdf|Page 9|Roofing system}}.

#### C. Doors, Windows, and Non-Structural Steel
